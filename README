Puppet Bootstrap v 0.1
----------------------

This little tarball contains everything needed to install the standalone Puppet execution script, and the git version control system.  To get started, simply run the bootstrap s\
cript.  This requires root privileges, so either su to root, be root, or run use sudo:

$ sudo ./bootstrap

This will install the tools, and run puppet to create a git user, and ssh key.
